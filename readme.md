Description: This is android application that plays the game of checkers. The user can play against a computer player of two difficulties. It shows the options for playing against human player and playing against an online player. These options do not work and will redirect the user to pick a different option 

2 difficulties 
    Computer Player(dumb)
        The player makes random moves
    Computer player Smart
        The player checks for all possible moves that would allow it to capture an enemy piece. It picks one of these moves at random. If it can not capture a piece then it looks for all moves that will not leave any of their pieces vulnerable to being captured. It picks one of these moves at random. If there are not safe moves or enemy captures available then it just does a random move


Rules 
    Moving 
        You can move pieces diagonally. You can only move pieces forward unless they have reached the other side of the board. If they reach the other side of the board they become a king and can move backward or fowards. 
    Capturing 
        To capture a piece an enemy piece must but in a spot where your piece can move. The spot and there is an empty square diagonally beyond the opponent's piece. Your piece most move to that empty square. If there is another piece that can be captured from your new position you can move it to that spot as well. You can catpure as many pieces as you can in one turn. If you have captured a piece and there are two pieces available on either side your piece will pick on at random to capture. This goes against the rules of checkers and needs to be fixed
    Winning 
        You can win with two methods. You can capture all the enemies pieces or you can put them in a positon where they can not move any more. 
    
ToDo
    -Make the human player be able to play against another human
    -Be able to play the game against an online player
    -Let the user be able to pick which side they want to go to if they can capture a piece on either side after they have capured a piece
